        <span class="home-text11">
          <span>
            For my first coop, I worked at the City of Toronto, in the
            Cybersecurity Division. The formal name is the Office of the CISO,
            but I will reference it as the OC in this reflection. This isn't my
            first time working here, as last summer I also worked at the OC,
            just not for a coop term. I originally only planned to work here for
            4 months, but I am now going to complete both my 2024 coop terms
            here as I am extending into the fall.&nbsp;
          </span>

        <h1 class="home-text14">Employer</h1>
        <span class="home-text15">
          <span>
            At the OC, the main goal is to secure the City of Toronto's
            applications and networks, and there are many different teams that
            support that goal. The team I am working on is called Cyber
            Engagement, which generally deals with the "frontend" side of
            operations. We interface with other divisions in the city to help
            them become or remain more cyber safe. I specifically work on the
            Strategic Transformation team, which configures solutions to help
            the OC run. During my time here, I have both programmed tools for
            many teams in the OC, as well as configured and implemented multiple
            solutions from vendors contracted by the OC.

            Over my work term, my main goals were to continue working on
            building tools and infrastructure to best support the teams of the
            OC. I generally wanted to do the same thing as I did last year, but
            also gain more experience working on more complex projects. Here are
            some of my main goals:

            I wanted to work on a project that tested my knowledge and
            experience
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Last summer I mainly worked with Jira automation and small tools in
            VBA. This summer I wanted to go beyond that and expand my experience
            to developing permanent solutions. I did this by leading the
            configuration of a tool called Process Unity, to help with our GRC
            (Governance, Risk Management, and Complience) pipelines.

            I wanted to work with experienced professionals and get a view into

          <br />
          <span>
            Last summer I worked with the client side team of the OC. I helped
            them build tools that helped that one team. This summer I wanted to
            actually be a part of a project team that made a tool that would
            help the whole OC / City. I was able to accomplish this by reaching
            out to my supervisors and asking about possible oppertunites I could
            be a part of, allowing me to be a part of a project team.

            I wanted to lead meetings and be able to convey information to
            multiple different groups of people

          <br />
          <span>
            I generally am someone who is comfortable speaking in meetings about
            things that I am confident about. This summer I wanted to lead
            workshops and meetings, to gain a better understanding of the topic
            and how to best explain it to multiple different groups of people. I
            learned that explaining something to one group of people can be
            vastly different than explaining that same thing to another group.
            It all comes down to their familiarity with the concept, and how you
            are able to explain it.

          <span>
            My Job Title was a Cyber Security Trainee, but I mainly worked on a
            project to implement a solution called Process Unity. As I said
            above, it is a GRC tool (Governance, Risk Management, Compliance),
            that allows the OC to track Cyber Risks and Threats throughout the
            City of Toronto network. I mainly lead the configuration of the
            tool, working with the vendor and my team to properly implement
            different requirements within the tool. I would also support testing
            of the tool and user demos. It really helped that I can pick up on a
            technology fast, as it allowed me to properly configure, document,
            and demo the tool.&nbsp;

        <span class="home-text51">
          <span>
            I will be continuing this position into the Fall, and am looking
            forward to expanding my knowledge in the Process Unity project, as
            well as others that are coming my way. I am really enjoying
            exploring cybersecurity and project development as a potential
            career path for me. I also worked with 7 other Summer Co-op
            Students. Even though I didn't work with them all directly, it was
            nice to meet people my age going into the same career as me. The
            connections I make along the way will be very useful in my future.
